# Amazon Vine Analysis
---

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to perform an ETL on Amazon reviews for a certain category of products, which in this case was video games sold on Amazon. The analysis compares reviews between members of their paid Vine program and normal customers who do not pay for the Vine program. The analysis observes the number of total reviews as well as 5-star reviews for both of the member types to see if there is any bias with the paid members.

## Results
While performing this analysis, the three main questions were:

1. How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
2. How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
3. What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

These were the results that answered these questions:

1. In total, there were 40,565 helpful reviews for the video game products on Amazon. Of that total, only 94 reviews were Vine reviews, while the other 40,471 were non-Vine reviews.

## Summary
After reviewing the results of the analysis, I can conclude that there is a positivity bias for the paid Vine reviews for Amazon products. Although the sample size of Vine reviews was very small compared to the number of non-Vine reviews, 51.06% of all reviews were 5-stars. On the other hand, only 38.7% of all non-Vine reviews were 5-star reviews. It is important to note that the results may have differed with even sample sizes.
